# Example


## Drop-in replacement (**favoring inference**) for default configs

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Flutter** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/flutter.yaml
```

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Dart** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/recommended.yaml
```

## Base config

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Flutter** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/base/flutter.yaml
```

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Dart** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/base/dart.yaml
```

## Config with strict requirement for **always specifying types**

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Flutter** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/typed/flutter.yaml
```

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Dart** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/typed/dart.yaml
```

## Config with strict requirement for **not specifying unnecessary types**

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Flutter** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/untyped/flutter.yaml
```

Example `analysis_options.yaml` file for **Dart** project:

```yaml
include: package:zekfad_lints/untyped/dart.yaml
```
